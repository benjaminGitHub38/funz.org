You can use Funz through several interfaces for both Windows, OSX and Linux:

  * [Command-line usage]({{ "/docs/usage_cli/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) 
  * [Python usage]({{ "/docs/usage_python/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) 
  * [R usage]({{ "/docs/usage_r/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}) 
  * [Java usage]({{ "/docs/usage_java/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

Each of these interfaces have its own requirements, in addition to Java required by Funz core itself.

As a short reminder of available commands, you can use the following cheatsheet:
